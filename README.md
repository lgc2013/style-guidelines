# Styleguides

## TL;TR - Absolute Minimum

- If the existing coding style is sane, stick to it.
- Avoid `defines` and `ifdefs` as much as possible.
- Do not use tabs, use spaces.
- Use 4 spaces to open a new indentation level.
- Names of signals, modules, and structs should be lower case with underscores as whitespace replacements (e.g.: `fetch_busy`). Names of constants and parameters should be upper case with underscores. Never use CamelCase.
- Instantiation of modules should be prefixed with `i_`, e.g.: `i_prefetcher`.
- For port definitions keep a post-fix direction (`_o`, `_i`).
- For active low signals put an additional (`_no`, `_ni`).
- Denote output of a register with `_q` and its input with `_n` (next) or alternatively `_p` (present) and `_n` (next).

## Coding Style

- Keep the files tidy. No superfluous line breaks, align ports on a common boundary.
- Do not use tabs, use spaces. If you really want to use tabs, use them consistently.
- Name dedicated signals wiring `module foo` (output) with `module bar` (input) `signal_foo_bar`
- Within an IP, use Interfaces to connect component instances whenever possible.
- Use Interfaces at the top-level interface of the IP, but also provide a wrapper that “unrolls” the Interfaces into input and output ports.
- Do not put overly large comment headers. Nevertheless, try to structure your HDL code, e.g.:
```
  // ------------------------------------
  // CSR - Control and Status Registers
  // ------------------------------------
```
- Specify memory map and integration rules while coding, using the `crazy88` (TODO: Link to Documentation) syntax.
- Put `begin` statements on the same level as the block qualifier, for example:
```verilog
module A (
    input logic flush_i
);

    logic whatever_signal;

    always_comb begin
        if (flush_i) begin
            // do some stuff here
        end else if (whatever_signal) begin
            // do some other stuff
        end
    end
endmodule
```
- The exception to the former rule can be the begin of an `always` block where the `begin` can be placed on a new line, for example (K&R):
```verilog
module A (
    input logic flush_i
);

    logic whatever_signal;

    always_comb
    begin
        if (flush_i) begin
            // do some stuff here
        end else if (whatever_signal) begin
            // do some other stuff
        end
    end
endmodule
```
> The rationale is that extra lines for `begin/else/end` carry no information at all. They even may prevent parts of the code to not have enough space on some screens. Process blocks on the other hand are more self-contained and multiple process blocks are not required to be visible at the same time.

The intention behind this is to keep code which is closely related together (like the code in an `always` block). It then should easily fit on a single screen.
- Give generics a meaningful type e.g.: `parameter int unsigned ASID_WIDTH = 1`. The default type is a signed integer which in most of the time does not make an awful lot of sense for hardware.
-  Name `structs` which are used as types with a post-fix `_t`:
```verilog
typedef struct packed {
    logic [1:0]  rw;
    priv_lvl_t   priv_lvl;
    logic  [7:0] address;
} csr_addr_t;
```
    ```verilog
    module A (
        input logic [11:0] address_i
    );

        csr_addr_t csr_addr;

        assign csr_addr = csr_addr_t'(address_i);

        always_comb begin
            if (csr_addr.priv_lvl == U_MODE) begin
                // do something fancy with this signal
            end
        end
    endmodule
    ```
- Consider using [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/):

```
# top-most EditorConfig file
root = true

# Unix-style newlines with a newline ending every file
[*]
end_of_line = lf
insert_final_newline = true
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
max_line_length = off
# 4 space indentation
[*.{sv, svh, v, vhd}]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
```
There are plug-ins for almost any sane editor. The same example `.editorconfig` can also be found in this repository.

## Git Considerations

- Do not push to master, if you want to add a feature do it in your branch.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
- Capitalize the subject line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Wrap the body at 72 characters.
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * :memo: `:memo:` when writing docs
    * :penguin: `:penguin:` when fixing something on Linux
    * :apple: `:apple:` when fixing something on macOS
    * :checkered_flag: `:checkered_flag:` when fixing something on Windows
    * :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * :fire: `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * :green_heart: `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
    * :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    * :lock: `:lock:` when dealing with security
    * :arrow_up: `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
    * :arrow_down: `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies
    * :shirt: `:shirt:` when removing linter warnings
    * :scissors: `:scissors:` when restructuring your HDL
    * :space_invader: `:space_invader:` when fixing something synthesis related

For a detailed why and how please refer to one of the multiple [resources](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) regarding git commit messages.

If you use `vi` for your commit message, consider to put the following snippet inside your `~/.vimrc`:
```
autocmd Filetype gitcommit setlocal spell textwidth=72s
```
